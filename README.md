# Credit_Risk_Analysis
`Predicting credit risk with machine learning models that I have built and evaluated using Python.`

## Resources
- Jupyter Notebook (Python 3.7.11)
- Data - LoanStats_2019Q1.csv

## Overview of the Analysis
Due to such an influx of data regarding loans and other personal finances, there is a substantial need for machine learning in order to both analyze this data, and predict trends for optimal lending. Therefore, as an aspiring Data Analyst, I will need to be familiar and utilize these machine learning algorithms and in this project, I will use machine learning with the purpose of predicting credit risk. Credit risk is generally unbalanced, with good loans existing in much higher volumes than risky ones. As such, I will use machine learning algorithms like SMOTE, RandomOverSampler, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEEN, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to oversample, undersample and reduce bias. After this is done, I will then evaluate the efficacy of these models and recommend whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results

My results consist and can be observed through the following 4 Deliverables:
